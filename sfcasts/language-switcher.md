# Create a Language Switcher

We have localized routing up and running, but we can only switch locales
by manually updating the URL. That won't do! Instead, let's add a language switcher!
Up here, next to our search form, we need a link to this page, but one for each of
our supported locales. But hmm... how can we generate a link to a route for a different
locale?

Peek into the web profiler for this request, and notice a bunch of
underscored request attributes. These are mostly internal to Symfony, but this
`_locale` one is important. When using localized routes, Symfony sets this
to the current locale of the request. What's cool, is that you can use this
as a route parameter to generate URLs to different locales.

For instance, to generate a URL for `app_homepage`, if you pass `_locale: 'fr'`
as a route parameter, the generated URL will be `/fr`, regardless of the
current locale.

Onto the widget!

## Building the Language Switcher

In the `tutorial/` directory, open `language_switcher.html.twig`, select everything,
and copy it. Now, in `templates/base.html.twig`, find the `<form>` tag, and just above it,
paste:

[[[ code('34df3b8f22') ]]]

Head back to our app and refresh, and here it is! It's just a stub right now,
but you can see how it should work. This button will show the current locale,
and when you click it, there's a drop-down with links to the other locales.

Let's wire this baby up!

Back in `base.html.twig`, find the anchor tag with the text "Language:". This
is the button. For this hard-coded text, `en`, we want the current locale,
we know how to do this already, `{{ app.locale }}`:

[[[ code('bd98a807a4') ]]]

Down in the `ul`, which is the drop-down menu, before the `li` tag, add
`{% for locale in app.enabled_locales %}`. I told you configuring `enabled_locales`
would come in handy! Under the `li`, add `{% endfor %}` and indent the guts.

This now loops though all the enabled locales, but *also* the *current* locale.
We want to exclude this, so add a condition before the `li` tag:
`{% if locale != app.locale %}`. Add `{% endif %}` below, and indent:

[[[ code('ac5ac9c06c') ]]]

For the link text inside the `li`, use `{{ locale }}`. For the `href`, we
*could* send them to the homepage for that locale... but we can do
better! I want them to stay on the same page, just with a different locale.

Check this out:
`{{ path(app.current_route, app.current_route_parameters|merge({_locale: locale})) }}`.
`app.current_route` gives us the current page's route name, and
`app.current_route_parameters` gives us the current page's route parameters.
Then we merge these with a new parameter, `_locale: locale`. This will
generate a URL for the same page, but with a different locale:

[[[ code('9aa3e219f4') ]]]

## Testing the Language Switcher

Moment of truth! Head back to our app and refresh. We're on the French
homepage and our widget shows "Language: FR". So far, so good! Click
the button, and here's our other locales, but with "FR" excluded. Click
"ES" - Spanish. Boom, we're on the Spanish homepage! Switch to
"EN", yep, we're on the un-prefixed, English homepage.

Click an article, and switch to "FR". Awesome! We're on the French version
of the same article. Our widget works perfectly: no more late night customer support
phone calls trying to walk a customer through changing the URL manually, and
in German! Das ist ja verr√ºckt!

## Removing the Trailing Slash

One *super* minor gripe of mine, is that when you're on a locale-prefixed
homepage, like `/fr`, there's a trailing slash: `/fr/`. There is no real
technical issue with this, I just dislike it. And it's super easy to
remove.

Open `config/routes.yaml`, and under the `controllers` key, add the option
`trailing_slash_on_root: false`:

[[[ code('89f6686477') ]]]

That's it!

Go back to our app... refresh... and the trailing slash is gone! Phew!
I can sleep easy tonight!

Ok, enough prep work! Next, let's actually translate some content!
